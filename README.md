## Feedbacker üìùüìÅ
This is a **simple** way for employers to gather *anonymous feedback* from their employees for use in a live discussion environemnt.

### Why?
Because its useful to have a live chat about potentially sensitive topics which people may not feel comfortable bringing up. This tool lets people post on a feedback board, and others to also upvote/downvote the comment to express their agreement or disagreement.

### Features
- **Live updates for all ‚è±**: once someone posts something it can be seen to all
- **Upvoting/Downvoting live ‚úÖ/‚ùå**. 300 comments saying the the same thing in different words is hard to parse; 1 comment with 299 upvotes agreeing with the sentiment is much easier.
- **Downloading Feedback üíæ**: After the session has ended and all feedback cast, the feedback can easily be downloaded into a .csv file for ease of use. This allows a quick reference in which feedback was the most agreed upon; this data can be colated and integrated into other services as it is in a ready-made csv file.
- **Rooms üè†**: Each room/board has its own roomId, and so many different boards can be created to keep feedback separated (e.g - can have a positive feedback board and a negative feedback board). This allows modularised feedback at a glance.

### Usage
To test this, clone the `main` branch. Then, start up the CRA dev server by running `npm start` in the root project directory (`C:/User/Desktop/feedback/` for example). Also, open another terminal and run the backend Express server to allow the WebSocket functionality by running `npm start` in the `/server` directory (`C:/User/Desktop/feedback/server`). Then, you can open up `localhost:3000` and see a screen asking you to create a room, or join a new room. Clicking `create room` will redirect you to an empty board, which will display a *Room Id* value. For others to join, share this value with them. Then, they will join the same room by putting this value into the `join a room` input field, then clicking `join a room` button. 

### IMPORTNAT NOTE
This is a *proof of concept* mainly. There are many bugs. There is not much error handling. You don't have to try hard to break this. However, I think the main functionality is here to allow easier feedback gathering for employers in a really simple way. Furthermore, currently all the messages for *every* board is stored on the server; this is not efficient, and may lead to a heap overflow (crashing of the server). In future, migrating this over to a more extensible platform may be benficial. Also, the rooms are only deleted when the server is shut off - the can exacerbate the aforementioned issue; make sure to close the server when you're done.
